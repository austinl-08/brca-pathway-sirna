# Pathway-Level Machine Learning Analysis of Breast Cancer Gene Expression for siRNA Target Prioritization

This project analyzes breast cancer RNA sequencing data to:
1. Compare tumor and normal breast tissue at the pathway level
2. Identify biologically interpretable pathways associated with cancer progression
3. Prioritize candidate genes within key pathways for potential siRNA-based silencing

Data source: TCGA Breast Cancer (BRCA)
Analysis environment: R
